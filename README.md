# Minecraft / Telegram Integrator

Connect Minecraft to Telegram in a simple, easy way! 🔝

## Installation

Simple. Download the .JAR file on the "Releases" section, and place it into the `plugin` directory on your Spigot server. 😎
Or you can compile it yourself. 😱

## Configuration

Simple as well. Inside your server's `plugin` folder, add a file called `mc-tg-integrator.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
token: your_telegram_token
group: your_group_id
```

Easy as pie! 🍰

## What if... ?

If the plugin crashes, it will explain in an wasy way why it did. If it does not, please open an issue here and I'll be more than glad to respond to you. I might even fix the bug you could've found! 🤔
